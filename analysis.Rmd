## Packages

Installing the required packages:

```{r}
required <- c("dplyr", "haven", "lubridate", "magrittr", "pdftools", "purrr",
              "rlang", "sf", "stringdist", "stringr", "survey", "tidyr")
to_install <- setdiff(required, row.names(installed.packages()))
if (length(to_install)) install.packages(to_install)
```

Loading the packages required for interactive use:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(survey)
```

## Loading and merging the data

The following function retrieves the definitions of the variables of a data frame:

```{r}
show_definitions <- function(df) {
  require(magrittr)
  df %>%
    sapply(attr, "label") %>%
    data.frame(names(.), .) %>%
    `rownames<-`(NULL) %>%
    setNames(c("variable", "definition"))
}
```

Laoding the children data set:

```{r}
ch <- haven::read_sav("ch.sav") %>% 
  dplyr::select(starts_with("HH"), # cluster information
                UF6, # fits with LN in mother's data set
                chweight, # weight
                ethnicity, # ethnicity
                HL4, # sex
                AG2, # age
                melevel, # mother's education level
                windex5, # wealth index quintile
                dplyr::starts_with("HF13"), # immunization info from health facility
                dplyr::starts_with("IM3"), # immunization info from vaccination card
                dplyr::starts_with("IM19"), # vitamin A campaign
                dplyr::starts_with("CA3B"), dplyr::starts_with("CA11")) # care
```

Loading the women data set:

```{r}
wm <- haven::read_sav("wm.sav") %>% 
  dplyr::select(HH1, HH2, LN, # cluter information
                WB2, # age of mother
                MT0, # has a mobile phone
                MN18, # place of delivery
                PN10, PN13A, PN13B) # post-natal check
```

The variables are the following:

```{r}
show_definitions(ch)
```

for the children and

```{r}
show_definitions(wm)
```

for the women. Merging the children and women data sets:

```{r}
attributes(ch$UF6) <- NULL # for the left_join() call
attributes(wm$LN) <- NULL # for the left_join() call
mics <- left_join(ch, wm, c("HH1", "HH2", "UF6" = "LN"))
```

## Mapping the regions

Downloading the map of the provinces of Vietnam:

```{r}
gadm <- "gadm36_VNM_1_sf.rds"
if (! file.exists(gadm))
  download.file("https://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/gadm3.6/Rsf/gadm36_VNM_1_sf.rds", gadm)
provinces <- readRDS(gadm)
```

Mapping the Vietnamese accents:

```{r}
dic <- setNames(as.data.frame(matrix(c("à", "a",
                                       "ã", "a",
                                       "á", "a",
                                       "â", "a",
                                       "ò", "o",
                                       "ô", "o",
                                       "ó", "o",
                                       "í", "i",
                                       "ì", "i",
                                       "ê", "e",
                                       "ú", "u"), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)), c("from", "to"))
```

A function to remove the accents of the Vietnamese names:

```{r}
translate <- function(x, dic) {
  for(i in 1:nrow(dic)) x <- gsub(dic$from[i], dic$to[i], x)
  x
}
```

Downloading the MICS report:

```{r}
mics_pdf <- "Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014.pdf"
if (! file.exists(mics_pdf))
  download.file("http://bit.ly/mics_vn", mics_pdf)
mics_report <- pdftools::pdf_text(mics_pdf)
```

Extracting provinces names per region from the table of page 429

```{r}
provinces_per_region <- mics_report[429] %>%
  sub("^.*List of Provinces\n", "", .) %>%
  sub("MICS.*$", "", .) %>%
  translate(dic) %>% 
  stringr::str_split("\n") %>% 
  first() %>% 
  lapply(stringr::str_sub, c(1, 11, 21, 59, 72, 81), c(10, 20, 58, 71, 80, 110)) %>%
  lapply(trimws) %>%
  do.call(rbind, .) %>%
  as.data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  `[`(-c(1, nrow(.)), ) %$% # the first row is the heading and the last one in empty
  c(.$V3, .$V6) %>% 
  `[`(-length(.)) # the last element is not a province
```

Extracting the position of the regions' names:

```{r}
regions <- names(attr(ch$HH7, "labels"))
regions_pos <- which(stringr::str_extract(provinces_per_region, "^.{3}") %in% unique(stringr::str_extract(regions, "^.{3}")))
```

Rearranging the provinces per region:

```{r}
provinces_per_region2 <- regions_pos %>%
  purrr::map2(., c((. - 1)[-1], length(provinces_per_region)), seq) %>% 
  lapply(function(x) provinces_per_region[x[-1]]) %>% 
  setNames(provinces_per_region[regions_pos])
```

Performing the approximate string matching:

```{r}
approxmatching <- data.frame(raw = unlist(provinces_per_region2),
                             matched = provinces$VARNAME_1[stringdist::amatch(unlist(provinces_per_region2),
                                                                              provinces$VARNAME_1, maxDist = 10)],
                             stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

One single manual fix is needed:

```{r}
approxmatching[approxmatching$raw == "Binh D ng", "matched"] <- "Binh Duong"
```

Mapping the regions:

```{r fig.height = 1.5 * 3.5, fig.width = 2 * 4.24725}
left_join(provinces,
          data.frame(VARNAME_1 = approxmatching$matched,
                     region = sub("\\d+", "", rownames(approxmatching)),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE), by = "VARNAME_1") %>% 
  select(region) %>%
  plot(main = NA, key.pos = NULL)
legend("left", legend = regions[c(2, 1, 3:6)],
       fill = sf.colors(6, categorical = TRUE)[c(4, 5, 3, 1, 6, 2)], bty = "n")
```

## Preparing the data

The function below removes the attributes of all the variables of a data frame,
which is required before the `gather()` calls:

```{r}
remove_attributes <- function(df) {
  require(magrittr)
  df %>%
    lapply(`attributes<-`, NULL) %>%
    as.data.frame()
}
```

### Calculating the number of doses for each vaccine

In the MiCS data we have information for 8 vaccines -- of which we will study
the MOV --, as well as 2 vitamin A shots (that will be considered for the
computation of the MOVs). The number of doses indicated in the table below are
the required number of doses. Note that these required numbers of doses are
expected to be given by the age of 1 year-old.

vaccine                                                           | MICS code        | number of doses
----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------
BCG                                                               | B                | 1
Polio                                                             | P1, P2, P3       | 3
*Haemophilus influenzae* type B                                   | I1, I2, I3       | 3
Hepatitis B at birth                                              | H0               | 1
Hepatitis B                                                       | H1, H2, H3       | 3
MMR (measles + mumps + rubeola)                                   | M                | 1
DTP (dipheteria + tetanus + pertussis)                            | D1, D2, D3       | 3
Pentavalent (DTP + hepatitis B + *Haemophilus influenzae* type B) | PEN1, PEN2, PEN3 | 3
Vitamin A first dose                                              | V1               | 1
Vitamin A second dose                                             | V2               | 1

In the MICS data, the information for each vaccine dose is coded by 3 column:
the day, the month and the year of the shot. There are also code for missing
values. These codes are:

```{r}
attr(ch$IM3BD, "labels")
```

Note that there are also true missing values in these columns (in the same that
both date information and missing value code are missing):

```{r}
any(is.na(ch$IM3BD))
```

The function `nbdoses()` considers that there was absence of shot when the YMD 
date of the vaccine was `NA-NA-NA`, `NA-NA-0`, or `0-0-0`. Everything else was
interpreted as presence of vaccination. Note that 

* `H0` has to be distinguished from the 3 doses of `H`: `H1`, `H2` and `H3`;
* `V1` and `V2` shouldn't be combined as if there were doses of a same vaccine.

Here is the code of the `nbdoses()` function where `df` is a MICS children table
and `pattern` is the pattern that characterize the vaccines columns:

```{r}
nbdoses <- function(df, pattern) {
  require(dplyr)
  require(tidyr)
  df %>% 
    select(matches(pattern)) %>% 
    mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
    remove_attributes() %>% # needed by the gather() call that follows
    gather("key", "value", -id) %>% 
    mutate(vaccine = sub("(.*).$", "\\1", key),
           time = sub(".*(.)$", "\\1", key)) %>% 
    select(-key) %>% 
    spread(time, value) %>% 
    unite("date", Y, M, D) %>% 
    mutate_at("date", na_if, "NA_NA_NA") %>% # here we specify the cases
    mutate_at("date", na_if, "NA_NA_0") %>%  # that are considered as
    mutate_at("date", na_if, "0_0_0") %>%    # absence of vaccination
    mutate_at("date", ~!is.na(.)) %>%        # (this has been checked).
    mutate(vaccine = vaccine %>%
             sub("(.*H0)", "\\10", .) %>% # to protect H0 (that is different from H)
             sub("(.*V\\d)", "\\10", .) %>% # to protect vitamins (that are use to compute MOVs)
             sub("\\d$", "", .)) %>% 
    group_by(id, vaccine) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(date)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    spread(vaccine, n) %>%
    select(-id)
}
```

Let's try an example:

```{r}
nbdoses(ch, "^IM3|^HF13")
```

The function `combine_series()` below works on an output of the previous
function and combines the numbers of doses from 2 series. The combination is 
obvious when the number of doses from one series are 0 or when the numbers of
doses from the 2 series are identical. In other situation, it is not clear what
we should do. The function `nbdoses_selection()` below is used by 
`combine_series()` and is the one that deals with the choices on the numbers of
doses when we combine the 2 series. The choice is regulated by the arguments 
`exclude_inconsistencies` and `keep_min`:

* if `exclude_inconsistencies = TRUE` all inconsistencies are excluded and the
final number of doses for this vaccine will be `NA`
* if `exclude_inconsistencies = FALSE` then
  + if `keep_min = TRUE` the smallest number of doses between the 2 series is
       considered.
  + if `keep_min = FALSE` the largest number of doses between the 2 series is
       considered.
       
```{r}
nbdoses_selection <- function(df, exclude_inconsistencies = TRUE, keep_min = TRUE) {
  require(dplyr)
  if (exclude_inconsistencies) return(mutate(filter(df, series1 == series2), nb_doses = series1))
  if (keep_min) return(mutate(df, nb_doses = ifelse(series1 < series2, series1, series2)))
  mutate(df, nb_doses = ifelse(series1 > series2, series1, series2))
}
```

Here is the code of the `combine_series()` function that uses the
`nbdoses_seletion()` function:

```{r}
combine_series <- function(df, pattern, exclude_inconsistencies = TRUE, keep_min = TRUE) {
  require(dplyr)
  require(tidyr)
  df %>% 
    mutate(id = row_number()) %>% 
    remove_attributes() %>% # needed by the gather() call that follows
    gather("key", "value", -id) %>% 
    mutate(series  = sub(paste0("(", pattern, ").*"), "\\1", key),
           vaccine = sub(pattern, "", key)) %>% 
    select(-key) %>% 
    group_by(vaccine, id) %>% 
    spread(series, value) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    setNames(c("id", "vaccine", "series1", "series2")) %>% # for the nbdoses_selection() call that follows
    nbdoses_selection(exclude_inconsistencies, keep_min) %>% 
    select(-series1, -series2) %>% 
    spread(vaccine, nb_doses) %>% 
    select(-id)
}
```

Let's try it when replacing all inconsistencies by NAs:

```{r}
ch %>%
  nbdoses("^IM3|^HF13") %>% 
  combine_series("^IM3|^HF13")
```

Considering the minimal value in case of inconsistency:

```{r}
ch %>%
  nbdoses("^IM3|^HF13") %>% 
  combine_series("^IM3|^HF13", FALSE)
```

Considering the maximal value in case of inconsistency:

```{r}
ch %>%
  nbdoses("^IM3|^HF13") %>% 
  combine_series("^IM3|^HF13", FALSE, FALSE)
```

### Computing MOVs

Below are the missed opportunities of vaccination (MOVs) that we will consider:

vaccine                           | missed opportunity with | code
--------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----
BCG                               | post-natal check        | mov1
hepatitis B at birth              | post-natal check        | mov2
polio                             | non-campaign vitamin A  | mov4
measles                           | non-campaign vitamin A  | mov6
polio                             | campaign vitamin A      | mov8
measles                           | campaign vitamin A      | mov10
polio                             | curative care           | mov12
measles                           | curative care           | mov14
DTP (diphteria, tetanus, rubeola) | non-campaign vitamin A  | mov15
DTP (diphteria, tetanus, rubeola) | curative care           | mov16
DTP (diphteria, tetanus, rubeola) | campaign vitamin A      | mov17
DTP or polio or BCG               | measles                 | mov18
BCG or hepatitis B at birth       | post-natal check        | mov_nn
polio or measles or DTP           | non-campaign vitamin A  | mov_pc
polio or measles or DTP           | campaign vitamin A      | mov_ca
polio or measles or DTP           | currative care          | mov_cc


The following function returns whether there has been a missed opportunity of
vaccination which is the absence of vaccination in the presence of care. This
rule needs to be protected so that `NA` instead of `FALSE` is returned when one
of care and vaccination is `NA` and the other one `FALSE`.

```{r}
mov <- function(care, vacc) {
  if_else(is.na(care) | is.na(vacc), NA, care & ! vacc)
}
```

### Data preparation pipeline

Below, we are assembling everything that precedes into a pipeline that prepares
the data. Note that all but the age of the mother (`WB2`) of the explanatory
variable are categorical. For two of these variables (mother education level 
`melevel` and wealth index quintile `windex5`), the levels should obviously
treated as ordered and this is what is done. For the other variables, levels will
be re-ordered at the analysis stage according to the magnitude of their effect
(see function `ordered_levels()` below).

```{r}
recode2 <- function(x) {
  labels <- attr(x, "labels")
  unname(setNames(names(labels), labels)[as.character(x)])
}
```

Questions:

* how are missing values dealt with for vitamin A?
* how are missing values dealt with for vaccine shots?

The pipeline function:

```{r}
data_preparation <- function(df, pattern = "^IM3|^HF13", exclude_inconsistencies = TRUE, keep_min = TRUE) {
  df %>%
# 0 - computes vaccines doses:
    (function(x) lapply(list(function(y) select(y, -matches(pattern)),
                             function(y) combine_series(nbdoses(y, pattern), pattern, exclude_inconsistencies, keep_min)),
                        function(f) f(x))) %>% 
    bind_cols() %>%
# 1 - replacing DK and missing by NAs:
    mutate(IM19A   = na_if(IM19A, 8), IM19A = na_if(IM19A, 9), # Vitamin A campaign in June 2013

           melevel = na_if(melevel, 9), # Mother's education level
# 2 - curative care:
           curative_care = trimws(paste(CA11A, CA11B, CA11C, CA11E, CA11F, CA11I, CA11J,
                                        CA3BA, CA3BB, CA3BC, CA3BE, CA3BF, CA3BI, CA3BJ)) != "",
# 3 - post-natal check:
           post_natal_check = ifelse(PN13A == "" & PN13B == "",
                                     FALSE,
                                     ifelse(PN13A == "?" & PN13B == "?",
                                            NA,
                                            TRUE)),

# 9 - converting to a survey design object:
    survey::svydesign(~ HH1 + HH2, strata = ~ HH6 + HH7, weights = ~ chweight, data = .)
}
```

Let's generate the data:

```{r}
mics_survey <- data_preparation(mics, pattern = "^IM3|^HF13", exclude_inconsistencies = TRUE, keep_min = TRUE)
```

## Analyses

### Proportions of children completely vaccinated

Let's estimate the proportions of children that are fully vaccinated per age
class, region and area type. The number of children per age class is:

```{r}
mics_survey$variables %>%
   group_by(AG2) %>%
   tally()
```

The number of children per region is:

```{r}
mics_survey$variables %>%
   group_by(HH7) %>%
   tally()
```

The number of children per environment is:

```{r}
mics_survey$variables %>%
   group_by(HH6) %>%
   tally()
```

Note that 

```{r eval = FALSE}
svyby(~ vaccine_status, ~ AG2, mics_survey, svyciprop)
```

doesn't work. Let's consider the following function instead:

```{r}
proportions <- function(svy, var, name) {
  require(rlang)
  require(dplyr)
  nb <- na.exclude(tally(group_by(svy$variables, !!eval(enquo(var)))))
# the sort() below is need because the group_by() above does sorting
  lapply(sort(na.exclude(unlist(unique(select(svy$variables, !!eval(enquo(var))))))),
         function(x)
           svyciprop(~ vaccine_status, subset(svy, !!eval(enexpr(var)) == x)) %>%
             c(., attr(., "ci")) %>%
             matrix(1) %>%
             as.data.frame()) %>% 
    bind_rows() %>% 
    `*`(100) %>%
    round(2) %>% 
    cbind(nb, .) %>% 
    `names<-`(c(name, "n", "proportion", "2.5%", "97.5%"))
}
```

That we can use to calculate the proportion of fully vaccinated children per
age class:

```{r}
proportions(mics_survey, AG2, "age")
```

Per region:

```{r}
mics_survey %>% 
  proportions(HH7, "region") %>%
  arrange(proportion)
```

And per environment:

```{r}
proportions(mics_survey, HH6, "environment")
```

### Proportions of 1-2 year-old children with MOV

From now on, we'll consider the following subset of children:

```{r}
mics_survey2 <- subset(mics_survey, AG2 == 1)
```

In order to account for potential non-linearity of the effect of mother's age,
let's discretize this variable:

```{r}
if (length(unique(mics_survey2$variables$WB2)) > 3)
  mics_survey2$variables$WB2 %<>%
    cut(., quantile(., seq(0, 1, le = 4), TRUE), include.lowest = TRUE) %>% 
    as.character()
```

Note that we convert it into character, as are all the other "independent"
variables. This is better in order to use the `svyglm2()` function below. Here
are the MOV variables that we'll consider:

```{r}
(y <- grep("mov", names(mics_survey2$variables), value = TRUE))
```

The following function builds a formula from a vector `x` of names of
explanatory variables and the name `y` of a dependent variable:

```{r}
make_formula <- function(x, y) as.formula(paste(y, "~", paste(x, collapse = " + ")))
```

For each of these MOVs, let's estimate the propotion of 1-2 year-old children it
affects:

```{r}
y %>% 
  lapply(function(x)
           svyciprop(make_formula(x, ""), mics_survey2) %>% 
             c(., attr(., "ci")) %>%
             matrix(1) %>%
             as.data.frame()) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  `*`(100) %>% 
  round(2) %>% 
  bind_cols(data.frame(MOV = y, stringsAsFactors = FALSE), .) %>%
  `names<-`(c("MOV", "proportion", "2.5%", "97.5%")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(proportion))
```

Note that there are no MOV6. We'll thus remove them from the analyses below:

```{r}
y2 <- setdiff(y, "mov6")
```

### Logistic models

In these section, we use logistic model in order to explain the presence of MOV
as a function of the following variables:

```{r}
x <- c("HH6", "HH7", "delivery", "melevel", "ethnicity", "windex5", "HL4", "WB2", "MT0")
```

#### Identification of confounders

A variable can be considered as a confounder if it's not independent of the
exposure. Thus, a first step in narrowing potential confounders is to generate
a matrix of independence between all pairs of independent variables. This can be
done by Wald tests on contingency tables in order to generate pairwise matrix of
independence as done below. This is preferable to a logistic regression as it
allows to test relationships between categorical variables of any number of
levels.

```{r}
nb <- length(x)
x_mat <- matrix(numeric(nb * nb), nb, dimnames = list(x, x))
for(i in 1:nb)
  for(j in setdiff(1:nb, i))
    x_mat[i, j] <- svychisq(make_formula(c(x[i], x[j]), ""), mics_survey2, "Wald")$p.value
```

The matrix looks like:

```{r}
round(x_mat, 4)
```

We can see that the sex of the child (`HL4`) is the only variable that is
independent from all the other ones. All the other variables are all highly
dependent of each other. And this remains true even if we apply a Bonferroni
correction for multiple tests:

```{r}
alpha <- .05
x_mat < (2 * alpha / (nb^2 - nb))
```

Thus, among our independent variables, only the sex of the child (`HL4`) can be
ruled out at this stage as a potential confounder. A second condition for a
variable to be considered as a potential confounder is that it should be
non-independent of the outcome. For that, we can proceed as done above:

```{r}
non_corrected <- sapply(y2, function(j)
                              sapply(x, function(i)
                                svychisq(make_formula(c(i, j), ""),
                                         mics_survey2,
                                         "Wald")$p.value))
```

Which gives:

```{r}
round(non_corrected, 4)
```

Thus, now, the potential confounders, for each MOV, are:

```{r}
(pot_conf <- lapply(as.data.frame(non_corrected),
                    function(x) setdiff(rownames(non_corrected)[which(x < .1)], "HL4")))
```

Note above that we exclude `HL4` from all the potential confounders. Last step
is to rerun all these models, this time correcting for potential confoundings.

#### Models correcting for potential confounding effects

The following function implements a partial likelihood ratio test (LRT) and
returns the corresponding p value:

```{r}
corrected_p_value <- function(x, y) {
  make_formula(c(setdiff(pot_conf[[y]], x), x), y) %>% # adding potential confounders
    svyglm(mics_survey2, family = quasibinomial) %>%  # runing binomial regression
    anova(., update(., make_formula(paste(". - ", x), ".")), test = "Chisq") %>% # partial LRT
    `$`("p")
}
```

Note here that, because of the `update()` call, we cannot put the family and the
design as arguments of the function. We chose not to include the `pot_conf`
object either. Let's try it:

```{r}
corrected_p_value(x[1], y[1])
```

Let's now apply it to all the independent and dependent varibles realationships
that need to be corrected:

```{r}
corrected <- non_corrected
with_confounders <- names(which(sapply(pot_conf, length) > 0))
corrected[, with_confounders] <- sapply(with_confounders,
                                        function(y) sapply(x, corrected_p_value, y = y))
```

which gives:

```{r}
round(corrected, 4)
```

to be compared with:

```{r}
round(non_corrected, 4)
```

Filtering out the significant relationships:

```{r}
alpha <- .05
corrected < alpha
```

Applying a multiple tests correction:

```{r}
(mt_correction <- corrected < alpha / prod(dim(corrected)))
```

The function below is a wrapper around the `svyglm()` function. It ensures that,
in the design, the last "independent" variable of the formula is ordered
according to the mean level of the dependent variable of the formula. This way
maximizes the chance of finding significativity of the last "independent"
variable when using a treatment contrast as is the default in R for unordered
factors:

```{r}
svyglm2 <- function(formula, design, ...) {
  require(magrittr)
  require(dplyr)
  vars <- all.vars(formula)
  y <- first(vars)
  x <- last(vars)
  levels <- svyby(make_formula(y, ""), make_formula(x, ""), design, svyciprop) %>%
    arrange(!!sym(y)) %>%
    select(!!sym(x)) %>%
    unlist() %>%
    unname()
  design$variables[, x] %<>% factor(levels)
  survey::svyglm(formula, design, ...)
}
```

Below, we use this function to compute the significant models. Note that, is the
names of the list's slots, `$mov101` means "first model for `mod10`",  `$mov102`
means "second model for `mod10`", etc...

```{r}
mt_correction <- as.data.frame(mt_correction)
mov_sel <- names(which(colSums(mt_correction) > 0))

models_sel <- mt_correction %>%
  select(mov_sel) %>% 
  lapply(function(x) rownames(mt_correction)[which(x)])

x_var <- unlist(models_sel)
y_var <- rep(names(models_sel), sapply(models_sel, length))
  
final_models <- purrr::map2(x_var, y_var,
                            function(x, y)
                              svyglm2(make_formula(c(setdiff(pot_conf[[y]], x), x), y),
                                      mics_survey2, family = quasibinomial))
```

Out of these final models, we need to filter out the models for which

* there is only 1 independent variable;
* this independent variable has only 2 levels;
* the effect of these levels is not significant.

Indeed, such models were selected as significant in the first place just
because including the independent variable made the mean of the MOV
significantly more different from zero than without the independent variable.
This is somehow an artifact of our selection method. The fonction below helps
correcting for this *a posteriori*:

```{r}
post_filter <- function(x, alpha) {
  coeffs <- coef(summary(x))
  !(nrow(coeffs) < 3 & coeffs[2, 4] > alpha)
}
```

Let's use this function to filter out and print the summary of these models:

```{r}
lapply(final_models[sapply(final_models, post_filter, .05)], summary)
```

In these models above, we'd expect to see at least one of the levels of the last
"independent" variable significant. This is not the case all the time. One
reason for that could be that the coding of the variable is not optimal and that
a recoding of it could increase the power of the test. This could be
investigated by a manual recoding of these variable but, given the values of the
p values, that's probably not very likely. An alternative explanation is that it
is again an artefact of our method. Let's thus filter out this models for now
and the function below does so:

```{r}
post_filter2 <- function(x, alpha) {
  coeffs <- coef(summary(x))
  rn <- stringr::str_extract(rownames(coeffs), "^.{3}")
  any(coeffs[rn == dplyr::last(rn), 4] < alpha)
}
```

Let's apply it:

```{r}
lapply(final_models[sapply(final_models, post_filter2, .05)], summary)
```

To get the odds and odds ratio, we need to exponentiate the values of the
coefficients:

```{r}
lapply(final_models[sapply(final_models, post_filter2, .05)],
       function(x) cbind(coef(x), confint(x)))
```

The conclusion of the analysis is that:

* MOV of DTP with curative care (`mov16`) increases as age of the mother
  decreases
* MOV of polio or DTP with vitamin A campaign (`mov_ca`) increases as the age of
  the mother decreases
* the presence of any MOV (including or not hepatitis B at birth) varies from
  region to region
